Here's a high-level design for an Â advanced file selection system:








Code Storage and uploading




use object storage like MinIO




Code Analysis and Indexing:




Develop a code analysis module that can parse and understand the contents of large codebases.Â 








Ideas explored:








Useing techniques like Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parsing or regular expressions to identify and extract relevant information from each file, such as:




	Imported dependencies
	Exported functions, classes, or modules
	API endpoints and routes
	Database models and schemas
	UI components and templates








Building an index that maps the extracted information to the corresponding file paths.








Semantic Analysis and Tagging:




	Enhance the code analysis module to perform semantic analysis on the codebase.
	Utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand the purpose and functionality of each file based on comments, variable names, function names, and other contextual information.
	Assign semantic tags or categories to each file based on its contents and purpose, such as "authentication," "user management," "dashboard," "data visualization," etc.








Intelligent File Selection:




	Development of an intelligent file selection algorithm that takes the user's request as input and matches it against the indexed and semantically tagged codebase.
	Use techniques like keyword matching, semantic similarity, or machine learning models to determine the most relevant files for the given request.
	Consider the relationships and dependencies between files to ensure a comprehensive selection of all necessary files.








Contextual Understanding and Refinement:




	Implement a feedback loop that allows the system to learn and improve its file selection accuracy over time.
	Collect user feedback on the selected files and whether they were sufficient for the given request.
	Use this feedback to refine the indexing, semantic analysis, and file selection algorithms.
	Continuously update and optimize the system based on real-world usage patterns and user expectations.








Api and web access




	Implement something like fastapi to allow upload and querying of the code.Â 








Web interface




	Need a GUI to allow me to upload codebase (zip) and allow me to do queries








To implement this design, you would need to leverage various technologies and libraries, such as:




	AST parsing libraries specific to the programming languages used in heterogenous codebases (e.g., Babel for JavaScript, ast for Python). At a minimum we should support react, react native, django, tailwind, js libraries like three.js
	NLP libraries like spaCy or NLTK for semantic analysis and tagging
	Machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch for building intelligent file selection models
	Indexing and search libraries like Elasticsearch or Lucene for efficient querying and retrieval of relevant files




additional requirements:




python 3.11
fastapi port 8004
all components local except LLM callsÂ 








By combining code analysis, semantic understanding, and machine learning techniques, your mission is to create an accurate file selection system that can handle complex codebases and adapt to the specific needs of many developers




your output needs to be an all inclusive zsh script, no placeholders that will implement all that WORKABLE. this will run on osx zsh and will have to create all dockers, compose, codebase
